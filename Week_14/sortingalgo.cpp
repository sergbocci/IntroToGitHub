sorting algorithms:

-Different approaches, different complexity + memory req.

Common algorithms:
- Bubble sort: simple, slow
- Insertion sort: simple, average case faster than bubble sort
- quick sort: complicated, fast
- Merge sort: complicated, fast

Bubble sort:
    Pairwise comparisons
    Highest value in arrary bubbles to last array position
    Repeats until data is sorted

Insertion sort:
    sorts left to right
    Looks at each element and loops
    back over what has already been sorted
    and inserts the element in the correct position

Merge sort:
    Divide + Conquer algorithm
    Divide the data into smaller + smaller chunks 
    Sort the chunks
    Merge them back together

Quick sort:
    Divide + Conquer 
    Chooses a pivot value from the array
    Everything less than pivot moved left + everything
     greater than pivot moved right. 
    Applies to smaller + smaller chunks of array. Selecting pivot and
        sorting relative to pivot value
