Variables: 
int, char, float, double - primitive types

What is the variable type needed for the problem you're trying to solve.

Operators - +, -, *, /

Strings - derived type, more complicated type, more complicated problems

User-defined types: classes + structs
    - grouping types to create a new type
    - encapsulation - controlled access to our data through public interface. Data integrity

Containers - vector, collections of array
    arrays - fixed size
    vectors - c++ interface to create dynamically sized arrays
    type agnostic - can put any type into it
    can add + remove elements during program execution

Control Structures: 
    structures for creating paths through the code based on input and variable values.
    - Conditionals - if else, else if, switch
    - Loops - for loop, while loop

Functions:
